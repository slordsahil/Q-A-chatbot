artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast array of industries.\\n\\nAs businesses and other organizations undergo digital transformation, they’re faced with a growing tsunami of data that is at once incredibly valuable and increasingly burdensome to collect, process and analyze. New tools and methodologies are needed to manage the vast quantity of data being collected, to mine it for insights and to act on those insights when they’re discovered.\\n\\nRed Hat named a Leader in the 2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™\\n\\nRed Hat was positioned highest for ability to execute and furthest for completeness of vision in the Gartner 2023 Magic Quadrant for Container Management.\\n\\nRead the report\\n\\nThis is where artificial intelligence and machine learning come in.\\n\\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\\n\\nWhat is machine learning?\\n\\nWhat is deep learning?\\n\\nAI vs. machine learning vs. deep learning\\n\\nWhy is AI/ML important?\\n\\nAI/ML examples and use cases\\n\\nGetting started with AI/ML in your organization\\n\\nWhat is MLOps?\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\nWhat is artificial intelligence?\\n\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) generally refers to processes and algorithms that are able to simulate human intelligence, including mimicking cognitive functions such as perception, learning and problem solving. Machine learning and deep learning (DL) are subsets of AI.\\n\\nDriving the AI revolution is generative AI, which is built on foundation models. Foundation models are programmed to have a baseline comprehension of how to communicate and identify patterns–this baseline comprehension can then be further modified, or fine tuned, to perform domain specific tasks for just about any industry.\\n\\nSpecific practical applications of AI include modern web search engines, personal assistant programs that understand spoken language, self-driving vehicles and recommendation engines, such as those used by Spotify and Netflix.\\n\\nThere are four levels or types of AI—two of which we have achieved, and two which remain theoretical at this stage.\\n\\nPut AI to work for you, the open source way\\n\\n4 types of AI\\n\\nIn order from simplest to most advanced, the four types of AI include reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.\\n\\nReactive machines are able to perform basic operations based on some form of input. At this level of AI, no “learning” happens—the system is trained to do a particular task or set of tasks and never deviates from that. These are purely reactive machines that do not store inputs, have any ability to function outside of a particular context, or have the ability to evolve over time.\\n\\nExamples of reactive machines include most recommendation engines, IBM’s Deep Blue chess AI, and Google’s AlphaGo AI (arguably the best Go player in the world).\\n\\nLimited memory AI systems are able to store incoming data and data about any actions or decisions it makes, and then analyze that stored data in order to improve over time. This is where “machine learning” really begins, as limited memory is required in order for learning to happen.\\n\\nSince limited memory AIs are able to improve over time, these are the most advanced AIs we have developed to date. Examples include self-driving vehicles, virtual voice assistants and chatbots.\\n\\nTheory of mind is the first of the two more advanced and (currently) theoretical types of AI that we haven’t yet achieved. At this level, AIs would begin to understand human thoughts and emotions, and start to interact with us in a meaningful way. Here, the relationship between human and AI becomes reciprocal, rather than the simple one-way relationship humans have with various less advanced AIs now.\\n\\nThe “theory of mind” terminology comes from psychology, and in this case refers to an AI understanding that humans have thoughts and emotions which then, in turn, affect the AI’s behavior.\\n\\nSelf-awareness is considered the ultimate goal for many AI developers, wherein AIs have human-level consciousness, aware of themselves as beings in the world with similar desires and emotions as humans. As yet, self-aware AIs are purely the stuff of science fiction.\\n\\nRed Hat OpenShift Data Science: Cloud services for AI/ML\\n\\nWhat is machine learning?\\n\\nMachine learning\\xa0(ML) is a subset of AI that falls within the “limited memory” category in which the AI (machine) is able to learn and develop over time.\\n\\nThere are a variety of different machine learning algorithms, with the three primary types being supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.\\n\\n3 types of machine learning algorithms\\n\\nAs with the different types of AI, these different types of machine learning cover a range of complexity. And while there are several other types of machine learning algorithms, most are a combination of—or based on—these primary three.\\n\\nSupervised learning is the simplest of these, and, like it says on the box, is when an AI is actively supervised throughout the learning process. Researchers or data scientists will provide the machine with a quantity of data to process and learn from, as well as some example results of what that data should produce (more formally referred to as inputs and desired outputs).\\n\\nThe result of supervised learning is an agent that can predict results based on new input data. The machine may continue to refine its learning by storing and continually re-analyzing these predictions, improving its accuracy over time.\\n\\nSupervised machine learning applications include image-recognition, media recommendation systems, predictive analytics and spam detection.\\n\\nUnsupervised learning involves no help from humans during the learning process. The agent is given a quantity of data to analyze, and independently identifies patterns in that data. This type of analysis can be extremely helpful, because machines can recognize more and different patterns in any given set of data than humans. Like supervised machine learning, unsupervised ML can learn and improve over time.\\n\\nUnsupervised machine learning applications include things like determining customer segments in marketing data, medical imaging, and anomaly detection.\\n\\nReinforcement learning is the most complex of these three algorithms in that there is no data set provided to train the machine. Instead, the agent learns by interacting with the environment in which it is placed. It receives positive or negative rewards based on the actions it takes, and improves over time by refining its responses to maximize positive rewards.\\n\\nSome applications of reinforcement learning include self-improving industrial robots, automated stock trading, advanced recommendation engines and bid optimization for maximizing ad spend.\\n\\nTop considerations for building a production-ready AI/ML environment\\n\\nWhat is deep learning?\\n\\nDeep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that attempts to emulate human neural networks, eliminating the need for pre-processed data. Deep learning algorithms are able to ingest, process and analyze vast quantities of unstructured data to learn without any human intervention.\\n\\nAs with other types of machine learning, a deep learning algorithm can improve over time.\\n\\nSome practical applications of deep learning currently include developing computer vision, facial recognition and natural language processing (NLP).\\n\\nNLP is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate text, which in turn allows large language models to perform tasks such as text analysis, sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition.\\n\\nAI vs. machine learning vs. deep learning\\n\\nSo deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which in turn is a subset of artificial intelligence. But what are the actual similarities and differences between them?\\n\\nA common way of illustrating how they’re related is as a set of concentric circles, with AI on the outside, and DL at the center.\\n\\nAs outlined above, there are four types of AI, including two that are purely theoretical at this point. In this way, artificial intelligence is the larger, overarching concept of creating machines that simulate human intelligence and thinking. The ultimate goal of creating self-aware artificial intelligence is far beyond our current capabilities, so much of what constitutes AI is currently impractical.\\n\\nMachine learning, on the other hand, is a practical application of AI that is currently possible, being of the “limited memory” type.\\n\\nBy and large, machine learning is still relatively straightforward, with the majority of ML algorithms having only one or two “layers”—such as an input layer and an output layer—with few, if any, processing layers in between. Machine learning models are able to improve over time, but often need some human guidance and retraining.\\n\\nIn contrast, deep learning has multiple layers, and it’s these extra “hidden” layers of processing that gives deep learning its name. Deep learning algorithms are essentially self-training, in that they’re able to analyze their own predictions and results to evaluate and adjust their accuracy over time. Deep learning algorithms are capable of independent learning.\\n\\nDL is able to do this through the layered algorithms that together make up what’s referred to as an artificial neural network. These are inspired by the neural networks of the human brain, but obviously fall far short of achieving that level of sophistication. That said, they are significantly more advanced than simpler ML models, and are the most advanced AI systems we’re currently capable of building.\\n\\n13 point roadmap:\\xa0How to start your AI/ML journey\\n\\nWhy is AI/ML important?\\n\\nIt’s no secret that data is an increasingly important business asset, with the amount of data generated and stored globally growing at an exponential rate. Of course, collecting data is pointless if you don’t do anything with it, but these enormous floods of data are simply unmanageable without automated systems to help.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning give organizations a way to extract value out of the troves of data they collect, delivering business insights, automating tasks and advancing system capabilities. AI/ML has the potential to transform all aspects of a business by helping them achieve measurable outcomes including:\\n\\nIncreasing customer satisfaction\\n\\nOffering differentiated digital services\\n\\nOptimizing existing business services\\n\\nAutomating business operations\\n\\nIncreasing revenue\\n\\nReducing costs\\n\\nAI/ML examples and use cases\\n\\nThat all sounds great, of course, but is on the abstract, hand-wavy side of things. So let’s take a look at some practical use cases and examples where AI/ML is being used to transform industries today.\\n\\nHealthcare\\n\\nAI/ML is being used in healthcare applications to increase clinical efficiency, boost diagnosis speed and accuracy, and improve patient outcomes.\\n\\nHCA Healthcare received the Red Hat Innovation Award for its use of machine learning to develop a real-time predictive analytics product—SPOT (Sepsis Prediction and Optimization of Therapy)—to more accurately and rapidly detect sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition.\\n\\nTelecommunications\\n\\nIn the telecommunications industry, machine learning is increasingly being used to gain insight into customer behavior, enhance customer experiences, and to optimize 5G network performance, among other things.\\n\\nIn fact, according to our State of Enterprise Open Source report published in early 2021, 66% of telco organizations expect to be using enterprise open source for AI/ML within the next two years, compared to only 37% today.\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\nIn the insurance industry, AI/ML is being used for a variety of applications, including to automate claims processing, and to deliver use-based insurance services.\\n\\nA majority of insurers believe that the modernization of their core systems is a key to differentiating their services in a broad marketplace, and machine learning is part of those modernization efforts.\\n\\nFinancial Services\\n\\nFinancial services are similarly using AI/ML to modernize and improve their offerings, including to personalize customer services, improve risk analysis, and to better detect fraud and money laundering.\\n\\nAs the quantity of data financial institutions have to deal with continues to grow, the capabilities of machine learning are expected to make fraud detection models more robust, and to help optimize bank service processing.\\n\\nAutomotive\\n\\nThe automotive industry has seen an enormous amount of change and upheaval in the past few years with the advent of electric and autonomous vehicles, predictive maintenance models, and a wide array of other disruptive trends across the industry.\\n\\nAnd of course AI/ML is a big part of this transformation. For example, it is a key part of BMW Group’s automated vehicle initiatives.\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\nEnergy providers around the world are also in the middle of an industry transformation, with new ways of generating, storing, delivering and using energy changing the competitive landscape. Additionally, global climate concerns, market drivers and technological advancements have also changed the landscape considerably.\\n\\nThe energy sector is already using AI/ML to develop intelligent power plants, optimize consumption and costs, develop predictive maintenance models, optimize field operations and safety and improve energy trading.\\n\\nRead more about AI/ML use cases\\n\\nWhat is MLOps?\\n\\nMachine learning operations (MLOps) is a set of workflow practices aiming to streamline the process of deploying and maintaining machine learning (ML) models.\\n\\nInspired by DevOps and GitOps principles, MLOps seeks to establish a continuous evolution for integrating ML models into software development processes. By adopting MLOps, data scientists, engineers and IT teams can synchronously ensure that machine learning models stay accurate and up to date by streamlining the iterative training loop. This enables continuous monitoring, retraining and deployment, allowing models to adapt to changing data and maintain peak performance over time.\\n\\nSee the MLOps infographic\\n\\nGetting started with AI/ML in your organization\\n\\nWhile AI/ML is clearly a powerfully transformative technology that can provide an enormous amount of value in any industry, getting started can seem more than a little overwhelming.\\n\\nThe good news is that you can start small. It’s possible to adopt AI/ML into your organization without a huge upfront investment, so you can get your feet wet and start to figure out how and where AI/ML can benefit your organization in smaller, easier to manage pieces.\\n\\nIf you’d like to know more, we’ve written a 13-point roadmap about how to start your AI/ML journey.\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\nAI/ML on Red Hat OpenShift\\n\\nTop considerations for building a production-ready AI/ML environment (e-book)\\n\\nTwo keys to adopting AI/ML: Data excellence and collaboration\\n\\nTop 5 considerations for your AI/ML platform (checklist)\\n\\nAI/ML Red Hat Open Innovation Labs residency\\n\\nAbout the author\\n\\nDeb Richardson            Senior Content Strategist, Red Hat Blog\\n\\nDeb Richardson joined Red Hat in 2021 and is a Senior Content Strategist, primarily working on the Red Hat Blog.\\n\\nRead full bioIcon-Red_Hat-Directional-A-Black-RGB\\n\\nMore like this\\n\\nBlog post\\n\\nOpen source and AI’s future: The importance of democratization, sustainability and trust\\n\\nBlog post\\n\\nOptimize application life cycles with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.10\\n\\nOriginal shows\\n\\nCompiler: Tales From The Database | Rolling With The Punches\\n\\nOriginal shows\\n\\nCompiler: Tales From The Database | Bad Bosses\\n\\nKeep exploring\\n\\nE-book: Top considerations for building a production-ready AI/ML environment\\n\\nVideo: Generative AI, the Ansible way\\n\\nE-book: Innovate and transform with a modern application platform\\n\\nBrowse by channel\\n\\nExplore all channelsIcon-Red_Hat-Directional-A-Black-RGB\\n\\nAutomation\\n\\nThe latest on IT automation for tech, teams, and environments\\n\\nArtificial intelligence\\n\\nUpdates on the platforms that free customers to run AI workloads anywhere\\n\\nOpen hybrid cloud\\n\\nExplore how we build a more flexible future with hybrid cloud\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nThe latest on how we reduce risks across environments and technologies\\n\\nEdge computing\\n\\nUpdates on the platforms that simplify operations at the edge\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n\\nThe latest on the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nInside our solutions to the toughest application challenges\\n\\nOriginal shows\\n\\nEntertaining stories from the makers and leaders in enterprise tech\\n\\nLinkedIn\\n\\nYouTube\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux\\n\\nRed Hat OpenShift\\n\\nRed Hat Ansible Automation Platform\\n\\nCloud services\\n\\nSee all products\\n\\nTools\\n\\nTraining and certification\\n\\nMy account\\n\\nCustomer support\\n\\nDeveloper resources\\n\\nFind a partner\\n\\nRed Hat Ecosystem Catalog\\n\\nRed Hat value calculator\\n\\nDocumentation\\n\\nTry, buy, & sell\\n\\nProduct trial center\\n\\nRed Hat Marketplace\\n\\nRed Hat Store\\n\\nBuy online (Japan)\\n\\nConsole\\n\\nCommunicate\\n\\nContact sales\\n\\nContact customer service\\n\\nContact training\\n\\nSocial\\n\\nAbout Red Hat\\n\\nWe’re the world’s leading provider of enterprise open source solutions—including Linux, cloud, container, and Kubernetes.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.
